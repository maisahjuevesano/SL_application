# About this project

This üë©‚Äçüíªproject is built in React & Typescript + Vite. The project language is swedish. I have chosen to build my own SL application as my finalüöÄ project for my üéìFrontend Development education at Medieinstitutet in Stockholm 2022-2024. üë©‚Äçüéì

## Description

I have chosen to buildüîß an application that I use in everyday life and can continue to use.üì±

In addition to the missing SL application, there are few functions such as a toggle button so you can choose a dark or light theme.

I also want a more fun and pleasant design. üí•üí´
üí°I would also like to be able to see the weather without going out of one app and into another.

Right now I have a temporary solution and that is to use cors-anywhere.
